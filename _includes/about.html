                <p class="col-lg-offset-7">We are a community of POC, LGBTQ+ people, women and disabled people who code in javascript.</p>
                <p class="col-lg-offset-7">We aim to bring together awesome underrepresented folks in technology for fun, collaboration, learning and solidarity.</p>
                <p class="col-lg-offset-7">Coding with others has been integral to our coding journeys, and we think that knowing other people like you helps with imposter syndrome and belonging, helping you stay the course in your career or simply to stick with programming through all the challenges and eventual triumphs.</p>
                <p class="col-lg-offset-7">We want wildcard to be a place where everyone can feel free to speak and express themselves authentically. Weâ€™re here to inspire and most importantly to learn from each other.</p>
